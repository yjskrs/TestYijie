Next person, please!

... Change this to a ticket.... Change this to a ticket...

Why is she just standing there?!

If we don't buy the tickets together, our seats will get separated...

Next person, please!

Ah... Yes.

H-Hey...

Hi... This.. Could you please change this to an entry ticket?

Okay! Lovely Flying, right?

Would the subtitled version for 10 minutes later be alright?

Yes.

Okay. Now you may reserve your seat from this panel.

Reserve... a seat...?

Yup! We don't allow free seating.

What does she mean by no free seating?

Shinomiya... Does she not know how to buy a ticket?

I knew she was a sheltered rich girl but I didn't think to this extent...

Let's organize our thoughts.

Firstly, our goal is this:

To watch this romance movie right beside Kaichou.

And then, touching my hand with his from time to time,

Allowing me to enjoy watching him squirm about!!!

Erm... Miss?

But, if this "reserving seats" thing were to fail...!

That's no joke!

I have to reserve a seat right beside Kaichou somehow!!
